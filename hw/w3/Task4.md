#### OBSERVATIONS :
It is observed that for different values of k,m between 0 to 3 the accuracy varies between 74% to 85% for the soybean dataset. The accuracy is maximum when m=1 and
it decreases as m increases (except m=0). Different values of k give same accuracy for m=1.

### CONCLUSION :
We would recommend **m=1** and **k = 0,1,2 or 3** because it gives the best accuracy.
